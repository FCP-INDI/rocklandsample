Using the S3 Data Downloader for the Rockland Sample-NKI Lite Release
----------------------------------------------------------------------

#TODO Add link
You can use a Python script located here to download the data as well.  This script includes a number of options so that you can download a customized subset of the sample for your needs.  In particular, it allows you to specify:

 * Age Ranges
 * Sex
 * Handedness
 * Visit
 * Scan Type 
 * Series
 * Whether or not to download some derivatives of the raw data (such as despiked physiological data collected alongside series or a mask used in the real-time neurofeedback study).

The visit names must be specified as one of the following visit codes:

 * Real-Time Neurofeedback
     * NFB2 - Visit 2 of the study.
     * NFB2R - Visit 2 re-visit.
     * NFBR2 - An alternative code for visit 2 re-visit.
     * NFBR2A - Visit 2 re-visit A.
     * NFB3 - Visit 3.
     * NFBA - Visit A.
     * NFBAR - Visit A re-visit.
 * Cross-Sectional Lifespan Connectomics
     * DS2 - Visit 2 of the study.
     * DSA - Visit A of the study.
 * Longitudinal Developmental Connectomics
     * CLG - Visit 1 for all studies.
     * CLGA - Visit A.
     * CLGR - Visit 1 re-visit.
     * CLG2 - Visit 2 of the study.
     * CLG2A - Visit 2 A.
     * CLG2R - Visit 2 re-visit.
     * CLG3 - Visit 3 of the study.
     * CLG4 - Visit 4 of the study.
     * CLG4R - Visit 4 re-visit.
     * CLG5 - Visit 5 of the study.

Example:

python download_rockland_raw_bids.py -o /data/output -v CLG4 CLG4R CLG5  

This will download all of the files for the cross-sectional lifespan connectomics study for the 4th and 5th visits and store them in /data/output in BIDS format.

Multiple scan types, separated by spaces after the scan type parameter, can be selected.  These scan types can take on the following values:

 * anat - Anatomical scans.
 * func - Functional/resting-state scans.
 * dwi - DTI scans.
 * fmap - Field map scans.

Example:

python download_rockland_raw_bids.py -o /data/output -t anat dwi

This will download all of the anatomical and dti data only across all visits.

Similarly, multiple series can be specified at the command line.  These series can take on the following values:

 * CHECKERBOARD1400
 * CHECKERBOARD645
 * RESTCAP
 * REST1400
 * BREATHHOLD1400
 * REST645
 * RESTPCASL
 * DMNTRACKINGTEST
 * DMNTRACKINGTRAIN
 * MASK
 * MSIT
 * PEER1
 * PEER2
 * MORALDILEMMA

Example:

python download_rockland_raw_bids.py -o /data/output -e REST645 DMNTRACKINGTRAIN

This will download only the data for these two series across all participants and visits.

Toggling the derivatives flag will also download the derivatives.

Example:

python download_rockland_raw_bids.py -o /data/output -d

This will download all of the data, as well as the derivatives (which aren't downloaded by default).

To get more information on all of the parameters you may use, type:

python download_rockland_raw_bids.py -h
